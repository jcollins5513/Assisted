*This granular plan focuses specifically on Section 7 of the master plan. Update this file at the end of the session to reflect completed tasks.*

## üéØ New Conversation Prompt

**Continue development of the Car Sales AI Assistant project, focusing on Section 4: Remote Background Removal System. Review the updated `granular-plan.md` for detailed tasks including file transfer and synchronization, background removal quality verification, and error handling and fallback mechanisms. The system now has comprehensive documentation from Section 7 and complete API integration from Section 6. Implement secure file transfer protocols, quality assessment algorithms, and comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable background removal processing. Focus on maintaining processing times under 30 seconds, 99.9% uptime, and providing actionable quality feedback while handling various image formats and network conditions gracefully.**
