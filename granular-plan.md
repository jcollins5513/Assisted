# 🚗 Car Sales AI Assistant - Granular Plan

## 📋 Current Session Focus: Section 5 - User Interface & Experience

### 🎯 Tasks (Section 5)
- [ ] Improve input readability (contrast, font size) across the app
- [ ] Add dark mode fine-tuning for inputs/placeholders
- [ ] Refine buttons and states (disabled/hover/focus) for key flows
- [ ] Polish Remote Execution pages (layout spacing, headings)
- [ ] Add inline status to Background Removal (live log/last error)
- [ ] Accessibility pass (labels, aria, tab order)
- [ ] Mobile responsive tweaks for forms and tables

### 🔧 Implementation Details
- Update `frontend/src/app/globals.css` to enforce input text contrast (done) and expand theme tokens
- Standardize form components under `frontend/src/components/` with consistent classes
- Add subtle status banner to `BackgroundRemoval.tsx` showing last backend message
- Ensure Tailwind config supports needed colors and states

### ✅ Done this session (from Section 4)
- Remote exec over SSH working end-to-end with Tailscale IP
- Wrapper script supports PythonPath for conda envs
- Boolean/number arg handling fixed for PowerShell
- Single-file vs folder handling corrected (-i vs -if)
- Input text readability improved in globals.css

### ⚠️ Carry-overs
- Background removal quality verification UI/algorithms (Section 4) – pending

## 🎯 New Conversation Prompt

Continue development of the Car Sales AI Assistant focusing on Section 5: User Interface & Experience. Use `granular-plan.md` to improve input/readability contrast, refine form components, polish Remote Execution and Background Removal pages (add a live status banner), and address accessibility and mobile responsiveness. Keep the existing remote background removal flow intact. Begin by auditing current inputs and buttons, then implement consistent styles and states across the app.
