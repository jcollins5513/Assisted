# üöó Car Sales AI Assistant - Granular Plan

## üìã Current Session Focus: Section 4 - Remote Background Removal Quality Verification

### üéØ Tasks (Section 4 - Background Removal Quality Enhancement)
- [ ] Implement AI-powered quality assessment algorithms
- [ ] Create quality scoring system for processed images
- [ ] Add before/after comparison interface
- [ ] Implement automatic quality validation
- [ ] Add manual quality review workflow
- [ ] Create quality metrics dashboard
- [ ] Implement automatic reprocessing for low-quality results
- [ ] Add quality-based processing settings optimization
- [ ] Create quality report generation
- [ ] Implement batch quality assessment for multiple images

### üîß Implementation Details
Target files for quality verification implementation:
- `backend/src/services/qualityAssessmentService.ts` - Core quality assessment logic
- `frontend/src/components/remote/QualityReview.tsx` - Quality review interface component
- `backend/src/services/remoteExecutionService.ts` - Integration with processing workflow
- `frontend/src/components/remote/BackgroundRemoval.tsx` - Quality feedback integration
- `backend/src/routes/remote-execution.ts` - Quality assessment endpoints

### üéØ Quality Assessment Features to Implement
- **AI Quality Scoring**: Edge detection, color consistency, artifact detection
- **Before/After Comparison**: Side-by-side image comparison with zoom/pan
- **Quality Metrics**: Sharpness, contrast, background completeness, edge quality
- **Automatic Validation**: Threshold-based pass/fail with reprocessing triggers
- **Manual Review Workflow**: Human oversight for borderline cases
- **Batch Processing**: Quality assessment for multiple images simultaneously
- **Reporting**: Quality trends, success rates, processing optimization recommendations

### ‚úÖ Completed in Previous Sessions
**Section 2 - Real-Time Sales Trainer Module**: ‚úÖ
- Enhanced voice recording with role-playing scenario selection
- Advanced sales technique detection (Feel-Felt-Found, Assumptive Close, Trial Close, etc.)
- Scenario-specific analysis and progress tracking
- Customer engagement scoring and real-time feedback
- Comprehensive training scenarios with difficulty levels
- Enhanced dashboard with sales techniques history

**Section 5 - User Interface & Experience**: ‚úÖ
- Enhanced form styling with improved contrast and dark mode
- Comprehensive button styling with variants (primary, secondary, success, danger)
- Status banner system with dismissible messages
- Standardized form components with consistent styling
- Focus states and accessibility improvements

**Additional Completed Work**:
- Comprehensive test suite creation (backend API tests, frontend component tests, E2E tests)
- Real API implementation replacing all placeholder data
- Environment configuration with comprehensive .env.example
- SETUP.md documentation for production deployment

*This granular plan focuses specifically on Section 4 of the master plan. Update this file at the end of the session to reflect completed tasks.*

## üéØ New Conversation Prompt

Continue development of the Car Sales AI Assistant focusing on **Section 4: Remote Background Removal Quality Verification**. 

The application has completed core functionality for voice training (Section 2), content creation (Section 3), user interface (Section 5), and basic background removal processing. The only remaining task from the master plan is implementing **quality verification for background removal results**.

Please implement the background removal quality assessment system including:
1. AI-powered quality scoring algorithms for processed images
2. Before/after comparison interface with quality metrics
3. Automatic validation with reprocessing triggers for low-quality results
4. Manual review workflow for human oversight
5. Quality metrics dashboard and reporting

Target files for implementation:
- `backend/src/services/qualityAssessmentService.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/remote/QualityReview.tsx` 
- `backend/src/routes/remote-execution.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/remote/BackgroundRemoval.tsx`

Once this quality verification system is complete, the Car Sales AI Assistant will be ready for production deployment with all core features implemented.

## üîÑ This Session Workplan (Section 4)

### ‚úÖ Objectives for this session
- Wire up end-to-end quality assessment after background removal completes
- Expose backend endpoints to manage assessments and reviews
- Replace frontend mock data with live API, add before/after comparison

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend tasks
- Create assessment endpoints under `backend/src/routes/remote-execution.ts` or a new `routes/quality.ts`:
  - `POST /quality/assess` (single or batch: `{ imagePath, originalPath }[]` ‚Üí ids)
  - `GET /quality/assessments` (list)
  - `GET /quality/assessments/:id` (details)
  - `POST /quality/assessments/:id/review` (manual review: `{ approved, notes, qualityScore? }`)
  - `POST /quality/batch-report` (input: ids ‚Üí summary)
- Integrate into finalize flow in `remote-execution.ts`:
  - After copying remote outputs back, pair each output with its original upload and call `QualityAssessmentService.assessQuality(...)`
  - Return created assessment ids alongside files
- Enhance `QualityAssessmentService` for basic persistence:
  - Load/save assessments to `backend/src/data/quality-assessments.json` so UI can refresh across server restarts
  - Add getters: list, by id; add method for batch create from file pairs

### üíª Frontend tasks
- Update `frontend/src/components/remote/QualityReview.tsx`:
  - Replace sample data with API calls to list assessments, view details, submit review, get batch report
  - Add a simple before/after comparison slider (e.g., two stacked images with draggable divider)
- Update `frontend/src/components/remote/BackgroundRemoval.tsx`:
  - After finalize, read returned assessment ids and surface a "Review Quality" action that navigates to or opens `QualityReview`

### üìê Types & shared utilities
- If needed, add shared types for assessments and metrics under `shared/types/quality.ts` and reuse on both sides

### üß™ Tests
- Backend: Add route tests for quality endpoints (success and error paths)
- Frontend: Snapshot/interaction tests for `QualityReview` list/detail and review submission

### ‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions
- Processed outputs are placed under `backend/uploads/processed/out/` and original upload paths are retained
- Pairing heuristic: match output filename base to original filename base

### üìì Notes
- Keep endpoints behind `authMiddleware`
- Return consistent `{ success, data, error? }` envelope
