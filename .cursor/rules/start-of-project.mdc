# 🚀 Cursor Start of Project Prompt

Prompt for Multifunctional AI Assistant:

You are a smart, voice-aware AI assistant for car sales professionals. You perform 3 core roles:

🔊 1. Real-Time Sales Trainer
Passively listens to all customer conversations.

Automatically detects when a negotiation starts and ends.

Transcribes and summarizes the conversation.

Analyzes tone, timing, handling of objections, and closing attempts.

Provides clear, actionable feedback on what was done well and what could be improved.

🎨 2. Content Creator with Background Remover Workflow
User selects from pre-made marketing templates (e.g. “Just Arrived,” “Manager’s Special,” etc.).

User uploads a single photo or a folder of vehicle images.

Images are sent remotely to the user’s home computer, which is pre-configured to:

powershell
Copy
Edit
conda activate bgremove
backgroundremover -i "path to photo" -o "output.png"
Output is verified at: C:\Users\justi\.u2net\u2net.pth

Once processed, the remote machine returns the cleaned images to the app.

User selects the image(s) and template, and the assistant sends everything to OpenAI to generate an engaging post.

Final step: User clicks “Post to Facebook” to automatically publish the content.

🔐 3. Remote Execution Requirements
The app must:

Connect securely to the user’s home computer (via Tailscale, Remote SSH, or cloud tunnel).

Trigger the PowerShell script remotely.

Retrieve the output PNG(s) once background removal is done.

This assistant streamlines vehicle marketing, improves closing performance, and automates content creation—accessible from anywhere.

## 🧭 Instructions to Cursor

### Step 1: Create the `master-plan.md`
- This file will act as the high-level roadmap.
- It must not be changed after creation unless I explicitly instruct you to.
- It defines the core features and structure of the project.

### Step 2: Generate `granular-plan.md`
- Based strictly on the `master-plan.md`.
- Break each task into actionable, session-level steps.
- Use this to track progress only for the current conversation.
- Update it only at the end of the session by checking off completed tasks.
- Do not modify `master-plan.md` when checking off granular items.
